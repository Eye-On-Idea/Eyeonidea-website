# Guide: Using SEO Fields Correctly

This guide explains how to use SEO fields inside your CMS.

SEO helps search engines understand your page.

## What this is

SEO fields control:

- Page title in Google
- Page description in search results
- Social media previews
- How search engines read your content

These fields do not change visible website text.

## What you can control

- SEO Title
- Meta Description
- Social share image (if included)
- Slug (page URL)

## What you should know

- SEO does not guarantee rankings.
- Clear structure matters more than keyword stuffing.
- Keep it simple and human.

### Step 2 — Write the SEO Title

This appears in Google search results.

Best practice:

- 50–60 characters
- Clear and specific
- Include your main topic

Example:
“Commercial Roofing Services in Aarhus”

Avoid:

- Very long titles
- Repeating the same word many times

### Step 3 — Write the Meta Description

This is the short text under the title in Google.

Best practice:

- 120–160 characters
- Clear summary of the page
- Invite the user to click

Example:
“Professional roofing solutions for businesses in Aarhus. Get expert advice and a free consultation.”

### Step 4 — Check the Slug (URL)

The slug is the page address.

Example:
`yourdomain.com/roofing-services`

Keep it:

- Short
- Lowercase
- Without special characters

Avoid changing slug after publishing unless necessary.
