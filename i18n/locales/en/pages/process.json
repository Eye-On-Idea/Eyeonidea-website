      {
        "question": "What does the deposit cover?",
        "answer": "The deposit (25–50% of total project cost) secures your project slot and covers the initial setup, planning, and early development work. It is non-refundable, as work begins immediately after payment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I make changes during the project?",
        "answer": "Yes. We offer optional check-in meetings (weekly or monthly) and you can provide feedback during the pre-launch preview. Minor adjustments within the agreed scope are part of the process. Changes outside the original scope may require a revised proposal."
      },
      {
        "question": "What counts as a 'small edit' during post-launch support?",
        "answer": "Small edits include text corrections (typos, grammar, wrong contact info), image replacements, and similar minor fixes. It does not include layout changes, new pages, new features, or visual redesigns."

      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a support plan after launch?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. After the 2-week post-launch window, the project is complete. A support plan is optional and is ideal if you want ongoing content updates, technical improvements, or strategic advisory. It can be added at any time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who handles hosting after launch?",
        "answer": "Eye On Idea handles hosting and server maintenance on OVH Cloud (EU-based). This is our ongoing responsibility as long as we host your project. Hosting costs are either included in a support plan or billed separately."

        "question": "Can I access the project during development?",
        "answer": "By default, you receive access to the test server 1 week before launch. If you'd like earlier access to follow development in real time, this is available as an optional add-on service."
