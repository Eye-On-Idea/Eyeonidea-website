  "overview": {
    "challenge": "Tegetec's existing website had outdated visuals, thin SEO coverage, limited accessibility, and dense technical content with no clear information architecture. The project had a fixed budget of approximately 20,000 DKK and a hard requirement to maintain near-zero mail downtime during the domain transfer.",
    "solution": "We delivered a full-stack solo project: a comprehensive UX and SEO audit, restructured information architecture with three primary navigation sections, a static Nuxt 4 build to eliminate backend costs, comprehensive Schema.org markup, EU cookie consent with GTM consent-mode, and a carefully planned DNS cutover to protect mail continuity.",
    "outcome": "Tegetec launched a modern, compliant B2B platform with a refreshed visual identity, clear navigation for their technical content, and a solid SEO foundation. The static deployment means minimal ongoing hosting costs, and GTM/GA4 is in place for data-driven decisions once traffic accumulates."

      "title": "Technical Content Without Overwhelming Buyers",
      "problem": "Tegetec's equipment specifications are detailed and technical, but the site also needs to be approachable for buyers who are not engineers.",
      "solution": "We used accordion and table patterns for deep specs, and card and stepper layouts for process overviews. This allows progressive disclosure so users can go as deep as they need without the page feeling dense."

      "title": "GDPR Compliance Within Budget",
      "problem": "Delivering a fully compliant cookie consent and analytics setup within a tight fixed budget.",
