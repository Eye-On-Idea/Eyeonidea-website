  "overview": {
    "challenge": "Tegetec's existing website had outdated visuals, thin SEO coverage, limited accessibility, and dense technical content with no clear information architecture. Content was structured around internal categories rather than how buyers actually evaluate and compare industrial equipment.",
    "solution": "We conducted a full UX and SEO audit, rebuilt the information architecture around three buyer-focused sections, and delivered a static Nuxt 4 site with comprehensive Schema.org markup, GDPR-compliant analytics, and a carefully coordinated DNS cutover to protect mail continuity throughout the domain transfer.",
    "outcome": "Tegetec launched a modern, compliant B2B platform with a refreshed visual identity, intuitive navigation for technical content, and a strong SEO foundation. The static deployment keeps ongoing infrastructure costs minimal, and GTM/GA4 is ready for data-driven decisions as traffic grows."

We benchmarked against OEM partner materials and aligned on clear goals: modernize the design language, restructure navigation for technical audiences, close SEO gaps, and put a support plan in place for post-launch. This phase shaped every decision that followed.",

    {
      "phase": "Information Architecture",
      "description": "We rebuilt the site structure around how buyers actually explore industrial equipment. Three primary sections emerged: Equipment and Solutions (system cards, process flow diagrams, chubmaker specs), Collaborators (OEM partner profiles), and About/Contact (regional offices, company background). Supporting pages for downloads, news, and GDPR compliance rounded out the structure. Anchor navigation and clear contact flows were designed for each section.",

We designed a custom token-based design system aligned with Tegetec's industrial identity. Accordion and table patterns handle deep OEM specifications without overwhelming buyers, while card and stepper layouts give process overviews a clear visual hierarchy. Local fonts and long-cache headers keep performance tight across all pages.",

      "description": "We implemented Schema.org markup across all major page types: WebSite, Organization, Service, AboutPage, and CollectionPage. Every page received custom titles, descriptions, keywords, and Open Graph/Twitter cards. The GDPR cookie layer was built with a prominent reject-all option and full script gating, ensuring no tracking loads before consent. Accessibility work covered skip links, focus-visible styles, reduced-motion handling, semantic table markup, and screen-reader labels throughout.",

      "title": "Domain Transfer with Mail Continuity",
      "problem": "Moving the domain to a new registrar and pointing it at the new static host needed to happen without disrupting Tegetec's business email, which runs on the same domain.",
      "solution": "We planned the DNS cutover in advance, locking MX records early and coordinating the timing of A/CNAME changes with the client. The transfer completed with near-zero email downtime and no lost messages."

    {
      "title": "Making Technical Specs Approachable for Buyers",
      "problem": "Tegetec's equipment pages need to serve two audiences at once: engineers who want detailed specifications, and procurement buyers who need to understand value and fit quickly.",
      "solution": "We applied progressive disclosure throughout - accordion and table patterns for deep specs, card layouts and process flow steppers for high-level overviews. Buyers can navigate confidently without being confronted by technical depth they don't need."
    },
    {
      "title": "GDPR Compliance Without Complexity",
      "problem": "Tegetec needed fully compliant cookie consent and analytics tracking, delivered cleanly without a custom backend or third-party consent SaaS adding ongoing cost.",
      "solution": "We implemented GTM consent-mode with a reject-all prominent banner baked into the static build. No tracking scripts load before the user opts in. The implementation is clean, auditable, and requires no ongoing maintenance overhead."
