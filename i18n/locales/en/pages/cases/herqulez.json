  "overview": {
    "challenge": "Herqulez is a modular fitness platform covering six areas - Core Fitness, Nutrition, Sleep/Recovery, Habits, Sport, and Travel - each with its own product identity. The marketing website needed to communicate a complex, multi-module ecosystem clearly without overwhelming visitors, while establishing trust ahead of the app launch.",
    "solution": "We designed and built a high-performance marketing website with Nuxt 4 that introduces the Herqulez ecosystem in a clear, visually engaging way. The architecture prioritizes performance and SEO, with multi-language support (English and Danish live, with more planned) and a GDPR-compliant analytics setup via GTM consent-mode.",
    "outcome": "The marketing site achieved Lighthouse scores of 99 (Performance), 93 (Accessibility), 96 (Best Practices), and 100 (SEO). It positions Herqulez for the planned MVP launch in early 2026, with a scalable foundation ready for additional languages and content."
