- Use and operate the Website for Licensee's own internal and commercial business purposes
- Modify the Website solely for Licensee's own business needs

The license granted under this Section shall survive termination, provided that the Licensee is not in material breach at the time of termination.

4.1 Licensor Rights

Licensor retains all intellectual property rights to:

- Underlying Components
- Development architecture, structure, and technical solutions
- Reusable code, layouts, design systems, and workflows

No rights are transferred by implication. Transfer of intellectual property in custom work created specifically for the Licensee is effective only upon full and final payment, in accordance with Section 55 of the Danish Copyright Act (Ophavsretsloven).

- Reuse the Website, in whole or in substantial part, as a template, framework, or basis for other websites, digital products, or client projects
- Make the Website publicly available as open source
- Remove copyright or attribution notices
- Represent itself as the author of the Website's technical or design implementation

6. Reuse by Licensor

Licensor may reuse general ideas, technical solutions, components, layouts, and design patterns from the Website in other projects, provided that such reuse does not include Licensee-specific branding, business logic, or confidential information.

Licensor may display the Website in portfolios and marketing material unless otherwise agreed in writing.

7. Third-Party Software

The Website may include third-party software subject to separate license terms.
Licensee agrees to comply with such third-party licenses. Licensor will inform Licensee of any material third-party licensing obligations relevant to the Deliverables.

8. Delivery and Defects

A defect notification period of 30 days applies from the date of delivery. During this period, Licensor will remedy any material defects in the Deliverables at no additional cost, provided the defects are documented and reported in writing.

After the defect notification period, any fixes or modifications are subject to separate agreement.

9. Warranty Disclaimer

The Website is provided "as is" after the defect notification period, subject to any mandatory provisions of Danish law.

Licensor makes no warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose or uninterrupted availability, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by Danish law, Licensor shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages, including loss of profit, data, or business opportunity.

Licensor's total aggregate liability shall not exceed the total fees actually paid by Licensee for the Website.

This limitation shall not apply in cases of intent (forsat) or gross negligence (grov uagtsomhed).

11. Payment

Payment terms are as specified in the project proposal. Unless otherwise agreed, invoices are payable within 14 days of the invoice date.

Late payments are subject to interest in accordance with the Danish Interest Act (Renteloven), currently the Danish National Bank's reference rate plus 8 percentage points per annum, calculated from the due date.

12. Confidentiality

Both parties undertake to keep confidential any proprietary information shared during the engagement. This includes business strategies, technical specifications, login credentials, and any information that a reasonable person would consider confidential.

Confidentiality obligations remain in effect for two (2) years after termination of this License.

Maintenance, hosting, updates, and support are not included unless agreed in a separate written agreement.

14. Termination

Upon lawful termination, Licensee shall cease use of the Website.

15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This License is governed by the laws of Denmark.

In the event of a dispute, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter through good-faith negotiation. If a resolution cannot be reached, disputes shall be submitted to the Aalborg City Court (Retten i Aalborg) as the court of first instance.

16. Entire Agreement

This License constitutes the entire agreement regarding the Website unless superseded by a written agreement signed by both parties.
